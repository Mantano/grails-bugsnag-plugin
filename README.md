# Bugsnag Grails Plugin

Current Version: 0.1

The bugsnag grails plugin integrates the bugsnag reporting client into your grails applications and automatically reports errors to the bugsnag service (www.bugsnag.com). Information reported by the client includes a dump of the original request (headers, cookies, query, original URL, etc), information about the currently logged in user, and a stacktrace of the error that occurred.
